# Google Ads <-> BigQuery

Standard SQL Query to join the various Google Ads tables (generated by the Google Ads Data Transfer) into a meaningful View on Adgroup level (more granular levels like Placement, Ad, and even click (GCLID) level is certainly possible but depending on the account size can get quite large and expensive to query)

### Prerequisites

- Google Cloud Account (with enabled Billing - you get min $250 starting balance which should be enough for a few months)
- Google BigQuery Project
- Google Ads Data Transfer: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/adwords-transfer

### Run the query

- Once the Google Ads Data Transfer is complete, navigate to the newly created tables and open the Query Editor
- Change the SQL settings to "Standard"
- Paste the desired Query from this repository into the editor
- Replace ```XXXXXXXXXX``` with the ID of your Google Ads MCC account
- Replace ```BQPROJECTNAME.TABLENAME``` with the Project ID & Table which contains the dataset in your BQ account
- Adjust the ``` INTERVAL 365 DAY ``` to however many days you want to fetch
- Run the Query and check the data

### Fetch data from Looker/Domo/Power BI/Tableau

- [Looker](https://looker.com/partner-network/google), [Domo](https://www.domo.com/connectors/google-bigquery), [Power BI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/desktop-connect-bigquery) and [Tableau](https://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/examples_googlebigquery.htm) all have inbuilt BigQuery connectors, so you can just use the same query for all of these tools. I might update this readme to include more information on how to use this query from all of these.
