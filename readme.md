# Google Ads <-> BigQuery

Standard SQL Query to join the various Google Ads tables (generated by the Google Ads Data Transfer) into a meaningful View on Adgroup level

### Prerequisites

- Google Cloud Account (with enabled Billing - you get min $250 starting balance which should be enough for a few months)
- Google BigQuery Project
- Google Ads Data Transfer: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/adwords-transfer

### Run the query

- Once the Google Ads Data Transfer is complete, navigate to the newly created tables and open the Query Editor
- Change the SQL settings to "Standard"
- Paste the desired Query from this repository into the editor
- Replace ```XXXXXXXXXX``` with the ID of your Google Ads MCC account
- Replace ```BQPROJECTNAME.TABLENAME``` with the Project ID & Table which contains the dataset in your BQ account
- Adjust the ``` INTERVAL 365 DAY ``` to however many days you want to fetch
- Run the Query and check the data

### Fetch data from Looker/Domo/Power BI/Tableau

- [Looker](https://looker.com/partner-network/google), [Domo](https://www.domo.com/connectors/google-bigquery) [Power BI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/desktop-connect-bigquery) and [Tableau](https://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/examples_googlebigquery.htm) all have inbuilt BigQuery connectors, so you can just use the same query for these tools. I might update this readme to include more information on how to use this query from all of these.
